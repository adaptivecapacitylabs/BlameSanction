BlameSanction
=============

Inspired by both [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt "Cloud To Butt") and [truthful-human-error](https://github.com/jonlives/truthful-human-error "Truthful Human Error"), this chrome extension replaces occurrences of 'blameless postmortem' with 'sanctionless postmortem'

Installation
============

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Drag BlameSanction.crx into the page that appears.
